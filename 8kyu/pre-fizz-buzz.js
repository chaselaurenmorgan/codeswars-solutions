// This is the first step to understanding FizzBuzz.
// Your inputs: a positive integer, n, greater than or equal to one. n is provided, you have NO CONTROL over its value.
// Your expected output is an array of positive integers from 1 to n (inclusive).
// Your job is to write an algorithm that gets you from the input to the output.



/*
Parameters will be a positive integer that is greater than equal to one 
Return an array starting with 1 counting up to the positve number 
Example 
    1 => [1]
    3 => [1,2,3]
    5 => [1,2,3,4,5]
Pseudocode 
create an empty arrary to push the numbers into
create a for loop that starts at 1 and goes the length of the n
